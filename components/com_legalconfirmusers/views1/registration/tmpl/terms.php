"Shine Internet", "we", "Warren Davies" - the primary designer/site owner and employees or affiliates
"Client", "you", "your" - the company or individual requesting the services of Shine Internet
…for the purposes of web site design or development. These terms and conditions set forth the provisions under which the Client may use the services supplied.

Shine Internet Ltd is an Internet Web design provider offering the Client graphical design, HTML, CSS and other related computer programming languages; incorporating services such as graphic design, photography, e-mail forwarding and any other necessary skills. Should Shine Internet Ltd waive any of these terms on an individual basis, this shall not affect the validity of remaining clauses or commit Shine Internet Ltd to waive the same clause on any other occasion.

2. QUOTATIONS
Quotes are valid for 28 calendar days from the date of issue.
The price quoted to the client is for the work agreed on the quotation only in association with the specification.
Should the client decide that changes are required after work on the website commences, then we will accept these changes with the provision that additional charges may have to be negotiated.

3. ACCEPTANCE OF WORK
An advance deposit of 25% of the total cost of the project is required before work can commence. After work commences this is non-refundable
The client's approval for work to commence shall be deemed a contractual agreement between the client and Shine Internet. Approval for the work to commence and payment of the advance fee indicates that the client accepts the terms and conditions outlined in this document.

We will agree a deadline submission date for your website content. If this deadline is not met, Shine Internet Ltd reserves the right to impose a surcharge of up to 25%.

Should the client wish to cancel the project at any point during the process they shall remain liable for the work that has taken place and shall be invoiced accordingly.

4. MATERIAL
Shine Internet Ltd reserves the right to refuse to handle:
* Any media which is unlawful or inappropriate.
* Any media which contains a virus or hostile program.
* Any media which constitutes harassment, racism, violence, obscenity, harmful intent or spamming.
* Any media which constitutes a criminal offence, infringes privacy or copyright.

5. COPYRIGHT
(a) Intellectual Copyright
Shine Internet Ltd will hold intellectual copyright of any material, including any source code and original images created for the client until payment of the final invoice. At this time we will transfer this intellectual copyright to the client.

(b) Client Responsibilities
In situations where the client provides images, text, animations or any other content for their website they are legally responsible for ensuring that this material does not infringe any copyright. Certain images provided by Shine Internet Ltd in the construction of the website may have been purchased under licence from stock image suppliers. These images are generally only licensed for use on a single website and may not be used in publicity material. The website owner is legally responsible for ensuring that this does not happen. If you wish to use any images from the site for other purposes please contact us for clarification.

6. DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS
(a) Browser Versions
Shine Internet Ltd makes every effort to design pages which display acceptably in the most popular current browsers, but cannot accept responsibility for pages which do not display acceptably in new versions of browsers released after pages have been designed.

(b) Domain and Hosting Costs
All third party costs arising from the registration of a domain name shall be met by the Client. Shine Internet Ltd recommend that clients register their own domain names so that they have full ownership of these but where we have registered a domain name on the client's behalf we agree to transfer this domain name to the client immediately upon request subject to any fees incurred by the domain registar.

(c) Search Engine Optimisation
Shine Internet Ltd are not responsible for the client's on-going web site promotion. Should the client require the site to be promoted on an ongoing basis a separate contract must be agreed. The order in which websites are ranked in the natural search results is controlled by the search engines. While we can optimise your site, we are unable to make any guarantees about the success of any search engine promotion activity.

(d) Conceptualising
Conceptualising is the process of producing website concepts for a client. Concepts can include site mock ups, graphics and design proposals. You should therefore ensure that you let us have your preferred colour scheme and design requirements beforehand. If you don't do this we will design the website appropriately but if it is not to your taste we may not be able to rework the website without additional charges. This is why it is often best to show us another website that you like as an example of what you require.

7. PAYMENT
(a) Method
Payment from the client must be paid by cheque made payable to Shine Internet Ltd in UK Pounds Sterling. This should then be delivered by post to our premises. Shine Internet Ltd accepts no responsibility for cheques being 'lost in post'.

(b) Returned Cheque Charge
If your cheque is returned by the bank as unpaid for any reason, you will be liable for a "returned cheque" charge of £25.

(c) Invoice Payment Deadline
Payment of any balance will be due within 30 calendar days of invoice issue date. Full publication of the Web Pages may take place only after full payment has been received. We will contact clients via email and telephone to remind them of such payments if they are not received when due.

(d) Late Payment
If the above term is not met you will be issued with a final reminder. Any content on the website may be removed if payment is not received within 30 calendar days of invoice issue date. When this occurs a minimum charge of £50 will be required to have the site restored.

(e) Late Payment Legislation
Accounts that have not been settled within 14 days of our final reminder will incur a late payment charge of 10% of the amount outstanding by the client.

9. FUTURE SUPPORT
The website is provided to and accepted by the client as a fully functioning, completed work; when the final payment is settled.
Unfortunately malicious software, spyware, viruses and website hacking are facts of life on today's Internet. It is highly unlikely that these will affect your website and Shine Internet Ltd will endeavour to protect it from this as much as we can during its creation. However, we cannot be held responsible for problems that develop on completed sites as a result of illegal activity.

Shine Internet Ltd cannot also be held responsible for any downtime your website may incurr do to technical server issues or for any contact forms that do not pass through from your website to your email facility.

10. COMPLIANCE WITH ECOMMERCE, ACCESSIBILITY AND OTHER REGULATIONS
We design websites in accordance with your specification. It is your responsibility to ensure that the website and its content comply with standing regulations. We cannot accept responsibility for any failure to comply with regulations related to accessibility, selling online or those related to a specific business or trade. We can research this on the client's behalf upon request, but in any business where complex compliance issues exist we recommend that the client takes legal advice from their company lawyer.

11. COMPATIBILITY
Shine Internet Ltd will endeavor to ensure that any developed/designed site or application will function correctly on the server it is initially installed in and that it will function correctly when viewed with the web browsing software Microsoft Internet Explorer Version 6 and to an acceptable level with Mozilla browsers. Shine Internet Ltd can offer no guarantees of correct function with all browser software.

12. WEBSITE HOSTING
Whilst Shine Internet Ltd offers to host websites via third party hosting providers, no guarantees can be made as to the availability or interruption of this service by Shine Internet Ltd cannot accept liability for losses caused by the unavailability, malfunction or interruption of this service, or for loss of turnover, sales, revenue, profits or indirect, consequential or special loss.

Shine Internet Ltd reserve the right to refuse to handle in any way, material which may be deemed offensive, illegal or in any way controversial, and also to terminate the free hosting service should the necessity arise.

13. YOUR PRIVACY
We do not share or sell any of your details with third party companies, without your express permission and we will only email you or contact you about work related matters.
